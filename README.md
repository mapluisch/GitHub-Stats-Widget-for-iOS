## Contributing

This project is open for contributions. Whether you're looking to fix bugs, add features, or improve documentation, your help is welcome.

## Addendum

- This project is mostly a way for me to get some practice in Swift as I would like to develop Swift-based apps for Vision Pro in the near future. I'm mostly used to Unity / C# and don't know the ins and outs of Swift (yet).
- All contributions, whether through code, bug reports, or feature requests, are appreciated (and will get a mention in update logs ðŸ˜Š).
